# geoLocation
First clone or download the project of geoLocation.
Create the database named 'geo' in localhost/phpmyadmin.
Import the user.sql file to the database.
Open the project in the browser and it will show the users location map page.
Go to the url and after localhost/geo write get_location.php such as localhost/geo/get_location.php.
And then you will find a input field page where you have click submit with your name.
Then after clicking the submit button your location's latitude and longitude will insert in the database and you will go to the localhost/geo/index.php page and you can see your location map with your name.
## Main Concept of this project
When Mr. Ahmed will fail to mention the location I will give him the link http://localhost/geo/get_location.php and when he click the link he will find the input field and he can submit his location's latitude and longitude.
And by his latitude and longitude I can find his location.
